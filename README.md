# About us

Rust is an incredibly safe and efficient programming language. Thanks to Cargo, it can even be used very elegantly, which is not the case with any other language in this form. However, some projects and libraries are missing because Rust is still very young.

## We want to change that

We specialize in porting and reimagining essential libraries and software from languages ​​like C++ into Rust. Our mission is to fill the gaps by creating high-performance, secure, and modern implementations where they've been missing, driving the future of software development.
